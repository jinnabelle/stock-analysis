# Stock Analysis using VBA (Microsoft Excel)

 
**Overview of Project**


**Purpose**
The Stocks Analysis project looks at performance of companies based on their stocks in the past couple of years. I summed up the total volume of each company and calculated the percent difference of their starting and ending price. The purpose of the project was to refactor the code we built in Module 2 to be able to analyze stocks data in a faster way.


# **Results**
Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

# **Summary**
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
